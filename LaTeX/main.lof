Parcels were launched in an evenly-spaced 5x5 grid with its lower-left corner at 41, -72 and upper-right corner at 42, -71. The large spirals are implausible for jet stream flow and reflect a problem with the model. \textit {Right}: The same parcels with trajectories calculated by the dynamic model with friction. A few parcels still exhibit unrealistic spirals, but in general, trajectories are more plausible.\relax }}{24}

Solid lines represent the threshold speed minus the trajectory speed for a timestep of 3 minutes. The dashed line at a velocity of zero represents the speed threshold. Note in the upper-right hand plot that the zonal speeds for some trajectories surpass the threshold. \relax }}{25}
