The large spirals are implausible for jet stream flow and reflect a problem with the model. \textit {Right}: The same parcels with trajectories calculated by the dynamic model with friction. A few parcels still exhibit unrealistic spirals, but in general, trajectories are more plausible.\relax }}{24}
