\section{Adding Friction to the Dynamic Model}

[Inertial circles have been encountered before in dynamic models and there are different ways of dealing with them.] \cite{stohl_accuracy_1998}
One approach, used by Stohl and Seibert, is to take a weighted average of the wind speeds from the dynamic model and interpolated speeds from a kinematic model at each timestep.
Another approach is to change the frictionless assumption of the dynamical model.
[Why does the force of friction damp oscillations?]
Using the definition of geostrophic wind in Equations \ref{eq:u_g} and \ref{eq:v_g}, Equations \ref{eq:uvelocitygeo} and \ref{eq:vvelocitygeo} with an added friction term become

\begin{align}
    \frac{du}{dt} &= f (v - v_g) - r_f (u - u_g) \\
    \frac{dv}{dt} &= -f (u - u_g) - r_f (v - v_g).   
\end{align}

The friction parameter $r_f$ is analogous to the Coriolis parameter: it has units of second$^{-1}$ and is a measure of the force of friction.
