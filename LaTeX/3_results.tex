\section{Adding Friction to the Dynamic Model}

[Inertial circles have been encountered before in dynamic models and there are different ways of dealing with them.] \cite{stohl_accuracy_1998}
One approach, used by Stohl and Seibert, is to take a weighted average of the wind speeds from the dynamic model and interpolated speeds from a kinematic model at each timestep.
Another approach is to change the frictionless assumption of the dynamical model.
[Why does the force of friction damp oscillations?]
With an added friction term, Equations \ref{eq:uvelocitygeo} and \ref{eq:vvelocitygeo} 

\begin{align}
    1   
\end{align}
